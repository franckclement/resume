      Metr is an iOS application for automated distance calculation for business trips.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Define your frequent departure and arrival locations.
      Calculation starts as soon as you leave a location, and stops when you enter a new location, even if the application is closed.
      For non-recurring business trips, Metr supports a manual calculation mode, triggered by the user.

      Using the iPhone's gyroscope and accelerometer allows the application to know if you're starting a trip by car or bicycle. 
      You're therefore not notified when you leave a location on foot, for example.

      Metr offers an export of your trips by week or month, with an estimate of associated mileage expenses based on the mileage expense
      scale of your country.

      I worked on the development of two native iOS and Android photo-taking applications.  
      The application centralizes photos of automotive claims by folders. It also ensures synchronization with BCA's IS.
      Photo folder synchronization is done via a bluetooth connection between the mobile application and a Windows professional tablet or through the network.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Carpix development covers the following topics:
      - QR Code scanner powered by ML Kit
      - Bluetooth transfer, via RFCOMM socket
      - Photo taking, import from gallery, copy photos from one existing folder to another, ...
      - Synchronization of app photos with smartphone gallery

      Design and implementation of an on-premise continuous integration platform
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      The mobile continuous integration platform project at IPPON was launched to industrialize, automate and improve the quality of mobile applications.
      The goal is to master the build chain for our internal applications as well as our clients' applications. As a bonus, we don't export any of our clients' sources outside our internal network.
      Applications are built, tested, signed and deployed on-premise on Mac minis within the IPPON network.  
      This platform supports native iOS and Android applications as well as Ionic, Flutter and React-Native hybrid applications.

      Takeover of an existing instagram-like iOS application for a French luxury player. 90% improvement in the time needed to connect to the application, complete navigation overhaul and associated graphic redesign.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      This project was carried out in three parts. First, improving application performance, particularly connection time to the application. Subsequently, a graphic and navigation redesign was carried out, replacing the burger navigation with a tabbar. 
      And finally, functional evolutions such as adding bookmarks and boards (bookmark folders) to user profiles, allowing them to classify their favorite posts.

    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      This project was an opportunity to update AssurOne's aging application. Including an Objective-C to Swift 3 migration.  
      Functionally, it's the addition of a quote contractualization tunnel, claim declaration and tracking as well as the graphic redesign that represented the biggest challenge.

      Development of a prospecting application for iPads with Ionic
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      The application offers a contact form for CASDEN agents at trade shows to prospect for leads. Since trade shows are not always covered by internet access, the application 
      securely saves this information on the tablet, and synchronizes prospect files with the CASDEN network when it's available.

      Development of a native Android mobile application for unloading asbestos waste containers.
      It replaces a paper communication process between the waste burial site reception and unloading teams.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      The application presents containers to be unloaded with either a truck plan view, representing containers as they are positioned in the truck, or a list view of containers.
      Weighing is done automatically using an industrial scale that communicates the weight to the application. The weight of each container is then communicated to Suez's IS.
      Agents can record anomalies during unloading if one or more containers are not compliant (wrong identifier, torn container, ...) with photo taking to document the anomaly.

      Creation of an iOS framework compatible with iOS 7+ respecting the provided architecture document. This framework is embedded in the client's store application, available in each brand store, on iPad.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      The framework fetches .zip files containing product collections, and associated prices. The .zip files are available on the client's IS. 
      The framework polls resources regularly, if a new package is available, it is downloaded,
      extracted and its content is placed in the file system of the application that embeds it. These actions are done in the background and scheduled by the framework. 
      Old resources are deleted and new product collections are viewable on the store application.
      
      The framework has an automated lifecycle and logs each of its actions which it then transmits to the client's IS.

      The Mobile Test Harness iOS application is a testing tool for the Transactional SDK that HID offers to its clients.
    description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      This project covers the design and development of the application. During design we developed jointly with HID teams a set of XML-like actions defining small scenarios understandable by the application.
      These small scenarios are read and interpreted by the application which will then execute the scenario actions.
      The application thus tests 100% of the SDK entry points.

      * iOS 5 to 8.2 support
      * 100% coverage of SDK entry points
      * Advanced multi-threading management
      * XML Parsing/Mapping
      * XSD validation of test scenarios

      I developed the ENBRIN application for EDF from creation to delivery. It's a very simple application for managing and viewing marketing PDFs.
      These PDFs are retrieved from EDF's IS via authenticated REST web services. The application offers a PDF viewing mode during prospecting sessions and an administration mode
      for PDFs after EDF partner authentication.
